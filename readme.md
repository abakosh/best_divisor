<h1> Best Divisor </h1>
<p>  This is a simple code to find the best ratio you can get of two integers to acheive a specific ratio. a/b = closest number to the defined number MY_NUMBER. a 
and b are limited between 1 and 255 , you can adjust the for loop value if you want to change the pool for a and b
you can pass any number if you dont want to modify MY_NUMBER. </p>

<code>./best_divisor 0.7843</code>

<p> This will return the following </p>

<code> a=40.0,b=51.0,val=0.7843 </code>
